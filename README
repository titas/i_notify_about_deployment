INotifyAboutDeployment
======================

This is to be used to notify redmine (or anyone who has email) about deployments.

The main idea is to integrate with scm and redmine to update issues on deployments, please read "Advanced" for that.

More Info
=========
Plugin hooks the rake task i_notify_about_deployment:notify to capistrano's after
callback (recipes/notify_redmine.rb).
Please support parameters to i_notify_about_deployment/config/.yml's.
If You want redmine to understand news via email please use my other plugin
http://github.com/titas/redmine-news-via-email-plugin
Also You can edit the body of email to suit Your needs.
If You are using capistrano then the recipe runs rake task remotely on Your server
with RAILS_ENV=#{environment You are deploying to}, su be sure to provide right information
to .yml's (email.yml especially)

Requirements
===========

This was created with ruby 1.8.7 and rails 2.3.5.
Works with capistrano 2.5 (didn't try others)
If ruby < 1.8.7 is used, please use action_mailer_optional_tls
tls plugin for gmail compatability.

Install
=======

Install in the project you want to send notifications, NOT redmine.
run script/install git://github.com/titas/i_notify_about_deployment.git
or copy manually, nothing is run on install.

Example
=======

rake i_notify_about_deployment:notify

Advanced
=======
Do You use redmine?
Do You have integration with scm?
Are You using "Fixes #2" or Implements "#11265" in your commits?
Is there a difference between "Resolved" and "Production"/"Testing" statuses in Your projects?
If all of those are true, You probably are changing all fixed issues status from 1st to 2nd on deployments manually.

No more!

Do not forget to add i_notify_about_deployment/config/i_notify_about_deployment_settings.yml[:to]
to redmine users who can post news for selected project.


Feedback
========
Is very appreciated!
Write me a message on github if You are using this :)
